    <div>
      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>Xenobeast Croquet is a chaotic racing card-overlap game.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>2-6 Players maybe more?</li>
        <li>? Minutes ... Target 20</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>Return to the ace, having stepped on the 2, 3, 4 and 5, in that order.</p>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Components</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>A deck of movement cards consisting of 3 copies of the following.
          <ul>
            <li>4 cards that move by different amounts forward and right without turning</li>
            <li>4 cards that move by different amounts forward and left without turning</li>
            <li>8 cards that shift forward and turn right by different amounts</li>
            <li>8 cards that shift forward and turn left by different amounts</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>5 wicket cards, marked ace, 2, 3, 4 and 5</li>
        <li>An identity marker for each player.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>Setup</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Arrange the wicket cards in a petagram pattern.</li>
        <li>Deal 5 cards from the movement deck to each player.</li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h2>On Your Turn</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>You should start with 5 cards. Draw up to 5 if for some reason you don't have a full hand.</li>
        <li>Play movement cards until you run out, choose to stop, or move off of the table.
          <ul>
            <li>Your first movement card of the game must touch the ace wicket.</li>
            <li>All subsequent movement cards you play must overlap with the last movement card you've played so that the back paw of the current card aligns with the corresponding front paw of the last card.</li>
            <li>If you step on another player's xenobeast, immediately draw 3 cards. This bonus can only be collected once for each other player on a single turn.</li>
            <li>If you step on the next wicket, immediately draw 3 cards.</li>
            <li>Either way your turn continues and you can use the new cards right away.</li>
            <li>A card must be able to balance on the table for you to play it.</li>
            <li>If you have cards left in your hand but none of them can be played because of the above rule, you may rotate your last played card, but you cannot play any more movement cards after rotating.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Move your identity marker to your last played movement card.</li>
        <li>Discard all the other movement cards you played.</li>
        <li>You may discard or keep any of the card still in your hand.</li>
        <li>Draw movement cards until you have 5 in your hand.</li>
      </ol>
